<a href="http://www.computerworlduk.com/toolbox/open-source/blogs/index.cfm?entryid=501&amp;blogid=14">interviewed by Glyn Moody</a>, one of the best journalists covering open source, for the ComputerWorld UK web site.<blockquote>
France is not a country many would associate with free software startups, but that's changing &#8211; not least because the French government is showing itself far more receptive to open source than its UK counterpart. One of the leading companies of this new Nouvelle Vague is Nuxeo, which was set up by Stefane Fermigier, now its CEO.
