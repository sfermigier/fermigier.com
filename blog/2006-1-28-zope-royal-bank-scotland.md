  an article</a> about a massive Zope deployment at the Royal Bank of
  Scottland (for an Intranet, it seems).<br><br>
  Unfortunately, the article gives absolutely no functional nor technical
  details. So it's hard to know of if this project is more impressive that<a href="http://www.nuxeo.com/clients/">some of the projects we did
  recently</a>.<br><br>
  Congratulations anyway to the people who worked on the project.<br><br><br>
