<a href="http://www.economic-majority.com/">Economic Majority</a> 
 (against software patents) webstite now has more than 1500 supporters which 
 is already a fair number, but could use even more support before the 
 software patents directive get voted by the European Parliament next 
 week.<br><br> 
  There are also many<a href="http://www.economic-majority.com/testimony/index.en.php">more
 testimonies</a> than last time I checked.<br><br> 
  Unfortunately, some MEPs, like<a href="mailto:emcmillanscott@europarl.eu.int">Mr Edward McMillan-Scott</a> 
 (brittish, conservative, vice-president of the Parliament) don't seem to get 
 it, and still believe that software patents will protect the small business 
 against the big corporations (they don't seem to have read a single line of 
 all the economic litterature that has been written on the subject, and 
 certainly not listened to the real entrepreneurs out there).
