Here is a message I just got from the [FFII](http://www.ffii.org/) regarding the upcoming vote on software patents in the European Parliament.

If the Directive is adopted in second reading by the Parliament, it would 
mean a tremendous blow to the european IT SMEs (and probably also some of 
the major players too) as well as for free / open source software projects who will have to 
sustain in the near future vicious attacks from our american competitors 
(and probably some others).

It seems there is still a little hope left, so we'd better not lose the 
last chances we have to change to course of the european IT history. It's 
time to act now.

Here is the mail I received:

> Dear Stefane Fermigier, CEO, Nuxeo,
>
> 1) The vote in the Second Reading on the software patent directive is in
11-13 work days, on 5-7 July.
>
> 2) Lobbying in Brussels is heavy, currently there is much pressure on MEPs
by pro-software-patent companies. The pro-patent lobby has about 30
lobbyists more than we, mostly wearing the hat of SMEs.
>
> 3) Your action is needed, at <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://noepatents.eu.org/">http://noepatents.eu.org/</a> we maintain
a list of what you can do as an SME and as an individual. Especially we
advise to see your MEP soon and, if you can speak for an SME, to visit the
Economic Majority conference 29 June Brussels <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://www.economic-majority.com/konf050629/">http://www.economic-majority.com/konf050629/</a>.
>
> Please decide to come the conference early, so that a date with your MEP or
with his/her assistant can be arranged in advance.
>
> With kind regards,
>
> Hartmut Pilch, G&#233;rald S&#233;drati-Dinet, FFII
