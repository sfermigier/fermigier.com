The <a href="http://www.nuxeo.com/publications/slides/meilleures-pratiques-du">slides
for my "Python best practices"</a> talk at the <a href="http://2005.rencontresmondiales.org/sections">"libre software
meeting"</a> in Dijon 10 days ago are now online after some minor 
polishing.

Unfortunately for non-french speakers, they are in french (but with a faire 
dose of english quotes and technical lingo ;) ) but I hope you will enjoy 
them anyway.

I don't consider the talk to be finished, there are many more things I'd 
like to add over time. You're very welcome to send me your comments by email (sf at nuxeo dot com).

I thank [Stefan Holek](http://twitter.com/#!/stefanholek) whose talk on <a href="http://www.python-in-business.org/ep2005/talk.chtml?talk=3001&amp;track=770">
"choosing good names"</a> at EuroPython 2005 was an inspiration for this 
talk.

And, BTW, it's official now:
<blockquote>
Pythonic is better than unpythonic ;)
