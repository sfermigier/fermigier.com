<p><a href="http://blogs.codehaus.org/people/vmassol/">Vincent Massol</a>, of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0596007507/">Maven</a> and <a href="http://cargo.codehaus.org/">Cargo</a> fame, came to visit the <a href="http://www.nuxeo.org/">Nuxeo 5</a> team yesterday to give us some advice on how to best use <a href="http://maven.apache.org/">Maven 2</a> to build and deploy Nuxeo 5 and ensure the best possible software quality for the product.</p><p>So, expect a few changes (= improvements) to the project&#8217;s <a href="http://svn.nuxeo.org/">SVN structure</a>, the <a href="http://maven.nuxeo.org/">Nuxeo 5 Maven site</a> and of of course the build system if you are already a developer (if you&#8217;re not, I strongly encourage you to consider <a href="http://www.nuxeo.org/sections/community/">becoming one</a>.) </p><p>And, BTW, we have identified a few features we could add someday to Maven (as a plugin) or Cargo, so expect some contributions from us in the future (expect, but don't count on it before the <a href="http://www.nuxeo.org/sections/about/roadmap/">Nuxeo 5.0 release next month</a>.)</p>
