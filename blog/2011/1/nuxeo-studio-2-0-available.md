We have made available earlier this week version 2.0 of Nuxeo Studio, the configuration and customization environment for content applications based on the <a href="http://www.nuxeo.com/en/products/enterprise-platform">open source Nuxeo EP platform</a>.

Here is <a href="http://www.nuxeo.com/en/about/news/nuxeo-studio-2.0-now-available">the announcement</a>

Nuxeo Studio 2.0 brings new important features, such as content views (which were introduced in <a href="http://www.nuxeo.com/en/about/news/nuxeo-upgrades-osgi-infrastructure">Nuxeo EP 5.4</a> last november) configuration, widget configuration, user groups management, content transformation, as well as usability improvement thanks to the feedback of our users.

Since Nuxeo Studio is a graphical tool, we thought it would be useful to produce a few screencasts to show how it's used in real life:

If you've got questions, there is a space in this Forum dedicated to discussing Nuxeo Studio: <a href="http://forum.nuxeo.com/f/16/">http://forum.nuxeo.com/f/16/</a>

Or join the <a href="http://www.nuxeo.com/en/about/events/event-nuxeo-studio-2">upcoming webinar</a> about Nuxeo Studio 2.0 on Feb. 9.

You can easily <a href="https://connect.nuxeo.com/nuxeo/site/connect/trial/form">try Studio for 30 days for free</a> (since it is a web application you don't need to download anything other than your <a href="http://www.nuxeo.com/en/products/document-management">Nuxeo Document Management</a> instance).

One last thing: if you want to use Nuxeo Studio to develop <a href="http://www.nuxeo.com/en/products/make-it-your-own">open source applications</a> (in other words, if you make the code of your application public under an open source license), you qualify for free access to Nuxeo Studio. Contact us with the description of your project (and the URL of its source code) and we'll ensure that you keep access to Nuxeo Studio after the 30 days trial is over.
