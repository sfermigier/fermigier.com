I have just finished writing a new white paper on the convergence of Big Data and Open Source.

You can find it here: ["Big Data & Open Source:
une convergence in√©vitable?"](/assets/pdf/bigdata-opensource.pdf) (PDF, 21 pages, French).

As this is the first version of this document, it probably still contains inaccuracies or misses important information.
