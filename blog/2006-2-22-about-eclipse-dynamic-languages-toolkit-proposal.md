<a href="http://www.xored.com/">Xored software</a> has submitted a while ago an Eclipse project proposal for a "<a href="http://www.eclipse.org/proposals/dltk/">Dynamic Languages Toolkit</a>".<br>

The aim of the project is to provide a framework and core components to support "editing, code navigation, debugging, and refactoring of code in dynamic languages", with Python, PHP and Perl as primary targets.<br>

To proceed, this project needs to gather support from other interested parties.
If, like me, you believe this project could provide a big boost to Python adoption in the software industry, you should probably get in touch with the guys from xored (<a href="mailto:info@xored.com">info@xored.com</a>) (sorry, I can't find information on the "proper" way to move this proposal forward).
