When all the smoke around the year 2000 has
finally cleared away, the survey suggests there will be a shift
away from the Windows- based client server environment. Within
a 3-year time scale, the majority of users are expected to have
moved to a network computing platform, with Java applications
taking a more dominant role. The survey also notes that Linux
is becoming an important industry trend. What is missing is an
industry leader pushing open software towards the mainstream,
but Merrill Lynch expects that by mid-year IBM Corp may slip
into this role, offering Linux service and support. This slide
towards open source has been backed up by Sun Microsystems
making Java in part open source. According to the survey, the
outcome of these changes could, in time, have as drastic an
effect on software pricing as the advent of microprocessor did
on hardware pricing.
