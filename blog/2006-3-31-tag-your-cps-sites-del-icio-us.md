Yesterday, following a suggestion of Tarek, we have started tagging public (internet) websites developped with CPS on <a href="http://del.icio.us/">del.icio.us</a> with the tag <a href="http://del.icio.us/tag/cps-site">cps-site</a>.

After one day, we already have more than <a href="http://del.icio.us/tag/cps-site">60 sites</a>. Not bad, for a system that we know is more often used for intranets (<a href="http://www.nuxeo.com/en/ecm/">ECM</a>, if you prefer) than for internet websites.

Please join the "CPS sites hunt" and add the tag to your sites.
