We've done yesterday a second release candidate for Nuxeo EP and DM.

You can download the packages (zip, windows installer, generic installer) here:

If you are running Debian or Ubuntu, you can also test it by adding:

<pre><code>deb http://apt.nuxeo.org/ natty releases datebased 
</code></pre>

and running <code>apt-get install nuxeo-dm</code>.

(You may substitute `natty` with `maverick`, `squeeze`, etc. i.e. the nickname of your current Debian or Ubuntu release but it won't change anything for now).
