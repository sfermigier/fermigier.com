<p>We&#8217;re still working very hard on the 5.2 M4, which has been delayed one more week and should be ready by the end of this week.</p><p>Here are a few technical highlights of what&#8217;s coming soon:</p><ul><li><p>The SQL repository will become the default repository in 5.2 (JCR storage will still be supported).</p></li>
<li><p>Workflow refactoring: the workflow API and implementation is being simplified, to be easier to use for developers.</p></li>
<li><p>Events refactoring: the event API and implementation is being simplified, to be easier to use for developers.</p></li>
<li><p>WebEngine: some refactoring to make it easier to use for developers (see a pattern here ;) ? ) Another huge improvement is that it is now possible to write the interaction classes in Java and have them hot-releaded by the server, increasing developers agility and pleasure.</p></li>
<li><p>Search refactoring: the Core is now responsible for search, the API has been simplified, Compass is gone.</p></li>
<li><p>A new &#8220;Converter&#8221; API that replaces the existing &#8220;Transformer&#8221; API, for content transformation.</p></li>
<li><p>GWT support.</p></li>
<li><p>Lots of other improvements, and new features, that will be presented in more details in the release notes.</p></li>
