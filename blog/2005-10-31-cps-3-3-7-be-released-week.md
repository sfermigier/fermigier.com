It won't include Jean-Marc Orliaguet's work on "<a href="http://svn.nuxeo.org/trac/pub/browser/CPSSkins/branches/jmo-boxless/">boxless
setup</a>" (rendering based only on portlets) which is still a bit instable
and should wait for the<a href="http://svn.nuxeo.org/trac/pub/ticket/586">CMFSetup Geddon</a>.

So, CPS developers, please don't try new funky stuff this week (or try it
in branches) and keep fixing bugs if you can.

This release already looks like one of the best and strongest since the 3.3
branch has been started. Let's keep up the good work until friday.
