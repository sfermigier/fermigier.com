Fabio Tranchitella wrote me this morning that Debian packages for CPS were available at his <a href="http://www.kobold.it/debian/experimental/">experimental Debian Zope
packages</a> web site.

More information in <a href="http://lists.nuxeo.com/pipermail/cps-devel/2005-August/001556.html">this
message</a> I sent this afternoon to the cps-devel mailing list.
