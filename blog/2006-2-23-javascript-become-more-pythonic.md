  Brendan Eich blog</a>:<br><blockquote>
   Given the years of development in Python and similarities to ECMAScript in
   application domains and programmer communities, we would rather follow than
   lead. By standing on Python&#8217;s shoulders we reuse developer knowledge as
   well as design and implementation experience. The trick then becomes not
   borrowing too much from Python, just enough to gain the essential benefits:
   structured value-generating continuations and a general iteration
   protocol.<br></blockquote>
  And:<br><blockquote>
   The wiki in which I typed that brief "let's be Pythonic" argument quoted
   above is a <a href="http://wiki.splitbrain.org/wiki:dokuwiki">docuwiki</a>
   instance set up for ECMA TG1 by <a href="http://www.venge.net/graydon/talks/mkc/html/index.html">Graydon
   Hoare</a>, who (I'm thrilled to report) has joined us at Mozilla recently.
   We hope to make this wiki world-readable at some point not too far off. In
   the mean time, I will blog with more details about the emerging ES4
   language design, and about what features from it will show up when in JS1.7
   and higher numbered versions to be shipped in Firefox 2 and 3.<br></blockquote>
