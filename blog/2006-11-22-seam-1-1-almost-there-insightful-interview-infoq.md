<p>As everyone should know now, <a href="http://www.jboss.com/products/seam">Seam</a> is an important part of our <a href="http://www.nuxeo.org/">Nuxeo 5</a> ECM stack.</p>

<p>We are currently using Seam 1.0.1, but it is nice to learn that Seam 1.1 is coming along, and it&#8217;s going to be very good.</p>

<p>There is a very nice (like always, on InfoQ) <a href="http://www.infoq.com/news/2006/11/seam-11-Gavin-King-interview">interview of Gavin King</a>, Seam&#8217;s creator, that explains in details where Seam is headed (rest assured that Nuxeo 5.1 <a href="http://www.nuxeo.org/sections/about/roadmap">will include</a> Seam 1.1, but let&#8217;s focus on the Nuxeo 5.0 release now ;) ). </p>
