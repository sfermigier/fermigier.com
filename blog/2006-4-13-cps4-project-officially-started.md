<p>
Two signs that the CPS4 project has officially started:
</p><ul><li>Florent has committed a <a href="http://svn.nuxeo.org/trac/pub/file/CPS4/trunk/doc/ROADMAP.txt">roadmap</a> in the SVN. (This roadmap will obviously be the basis for <a href="http://www.zope.org/Members/nuxeo/news/z3ecm-sprint-2006">next week sprint</a> at Nuxeo's office in Paris).</li>

<li>The <a href="http://lists.nuxeo.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/cps4">CPS4</a> mailing list is now open for the community (and last week's private discussion <a href="http://lists.nuxeo.com/pipermail/cps4/2006-April/date.html">archives</a> are available too).</li>

</ul><p>
Now, you may ask, "what is CPS4?"
</p><p>
In a couple of sentences, that will be expanded in upcoming blog postings: CPS4 is the evolution of CPS3 towards more <a href="http://lists.nuxeo.com/pipermail/z3lab/2005-May/000020.html">openness</a> and more scalability. We keep all the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterprise_content_management">ECM</a> functions we like in <a href="http://www.cps-project.org/sections/about/cps-platform-framework-r">CPS framework</a> (the repository, the documents schemas, the directories, events, skins, portlets, relations...) , and we leverage both the work done on the <a href="http://www.z3lab.org/">Z3ECM</a> project, and
the offering of the Apache project (<a href="http://lucene.apache.org/">Lucene</a>, <a href="http://jackrabbit.apache.org/">Jackrabbit</a>) and a few other established infrastructure Java projects. Last thing: we plan to use the <a href="http://www.zeroc.com/">ICE</a> high-performance communication engine for communication between the different components.
</p><p>
FAQ: "Is the CPS 3.4 branch still supported?" R: of course, we also plan to do a CPS 3.4.1 release very soon.
