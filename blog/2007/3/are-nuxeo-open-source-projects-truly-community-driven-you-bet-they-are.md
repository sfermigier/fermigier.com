<p>Dion Almaer wrote yesterday a <a href="http://www.almaer.com/blog/archives/001412.html">blog entry</a> with a list of criteria that, in his opinion, make an open source project truly <a href="http://www.nuxeo.org/sections/community/">community-driven</a> (which is, of course, a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_thing">Good Thing(tm)</a>). </p><p>I had some apprehension, while reading the blog entry&#8217;s title, because, of course, we <em>want</em> to be community-driven (that&#8217;s one of the criteria BTW), but what if we had forgotten something important?</p><p>Fortunately, the short answer is &#8220;of course we are community-driven&#8221;. With Dion&#8217;s criteria, I can confidently self-grade us at A+ (or 20/20, for french-educated people). Here are the criteria and my comments:</p><blockquote>
  <p>If you don&#8217;t have any commiters from outside of your company. You probably aren&#8217;t community driven.</p>
</blockquote><p>Half of the commiters in the <a href="http://www.nuxeo.org/">Nuxeo project</a> are not Nuxeo employees, and we are actively trying to <a href="http://blogs.nuxeo.com/sections/blogs/fermigier/2007_03_07_back-from-braincamp-ouverture-2007">recruit more contributors</a>.</p><blockquote>
  <p>If you didn&#8217;t spend time cleaning up documentation for the community when you opened it up. You probably aren&#8217;t community driven.</p>
</blockquote><p>We&#8217;ve produced already several hundreds of pages of <a href="http://www.nuxeo.org/sections/documentation/">users and developers documentation</a>, and we&#8217;ve gone through great efforts in producing this documentation in time for the first public releases of the software.</p><blockquote>
  <p>If your users haven&#8217;t helped with the documentation if it is lacking. You probably aren&#8217;t community driven.</p>
</blockquote><p>We got great feedback from our users regarding the documentation, and we&#8217;ve already had user-contributed sections in some of our manuals.</p><blockquote>
  <p>If you do not have some kind of forums/lists where people help each other out. You probably aren&#8217;t community driven.</p>
</blockquote><p>We have several <a href="http://lists.nuxeo.com/">mailing lists</a> for all of our projects, with a total of about 1500 subscribers.  </p><blockquote>
  <p>If you aren&#8217;t willing to put in a lot of effort to build your community to get true benefits. You probably aren&#8217;t community driven.</p>
</blockquote><p>Yes, we&#8217;re putting a lot of efforts, and we get the rewards of course.</p><p>But there is something more important, that is not explicitly stated in Dion&#8217;s criteria: we have <em>designed</em> the Nuxeo software with the explicit goal of creating an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architecture_of_participation">Architecture of Participation</a> (a term coined by Tim O&#8217;Reilly, Dion&#8217;s boss, BTW). Our creation of <a href="http://www.nuxeo.org/sections/projects/runtime/">Nuxeo Runtime</a>, the OSGi-based plugin system (inspired by Eclipse&#8217;s), our use of a component framework like <a href="http://www.jboss.com/products/seam">JBoss Seam</a> for our webapp, are consequences of this vision, which comes from years of experience working with system integrators and ISV.</p><p>Extensibility at all levels is one of the majors criteria of a successful historical open source project (think Eclipse&#8217;s or Mozilla&#8217;s plugins, Emacs scripts, LaTeX packages, etc.). Monolithic apps usually don&#8217;t make great open source communities. That&#8217;s a lesson we will never forget!</p>
