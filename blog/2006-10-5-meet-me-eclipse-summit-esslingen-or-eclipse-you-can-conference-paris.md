I will be in Esslingen next week for the <a href="http://www.eclipsecon.org/summiteurope2006/index.php?page=program/">eclipse Summit</a>.
  
I&#8217;m going to talk about <a href="http://www.nuxeo.org/sections/projects/rcp">Nuxeo RCP</a>, the rich client side of our <a href="http://www.nuxeo.org/">Nuxeo ECM project</a>, and about the <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/proposals/apogee/">Apog&#233;e project</a>, which is now an official Eclipse Foundation technology project.

Then I will be at the <a href="http://www.tni-software.com/fr/eclipse_now_you_can/eclipse_index.html">Eclipse Now You can</a> one day conference in Paris. Similar program for us, except I won&#8217;t be delivering the talk myself (you have to share the fun of giving talks with your colleagues, right Laurent ;) ).

I&#8217;m looking forward to talk to people interested in our project, so we can discuss how to best collaborate together.

Watch this space for a report on both conferences, and for the slides that are not done yet.
