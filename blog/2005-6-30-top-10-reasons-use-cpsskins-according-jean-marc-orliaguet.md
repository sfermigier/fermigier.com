Jean-Marc&#39;s slides for his Europython 2005 talk are <a href="http://www.medic.chalmers.se/%7Ejmo/CPS/cpsskins-ep2005.pdf">now
online</a>.

One great thing about his talk is that he's come up with a "Top 10 reasons 
to use CPSSkins" which are:

<ul>
<li>10. modify your site design without restarting the server</li>
<li>9. cache page fragments without setting up a Squid</li>
<li>8. create a design that works on all CSS2-compliant browsers</li>
<li>7. do tableless design without spending hours on it</li>
<li>6. respect Web standards without reading the W3 specs</li>
<li>5. create visual variation across your site</li>
<li>4. prevent content creators from altering the site's design</li>
<li>3. allow content creators to be more creative, but not too much</li>
<li>2. focus on form and content and not just on technique</li>
<li>1. don't reinvent the wheel, spend time on real development</li>
</ul>

One can read more background information about CPSSkins in <a href="http://www.medic.chalmers.se/%7Ejmo/ep2004/presentation.pdf">Jean-Marc's
last year talk</a> (but this was before the introduction of portlets into
the framework, so things have changed quite a bit this last year).

I think that <a href="http://www.medic.chalmers.se/%7Ejmo/CPS/">CPSSkins</a> doesn't yet
have the success it deserves, probably because people don't yet get the
whole advantage they can get from using it, and this is a shame because it
is really a terrific product.
