vieux (semble-t-il) papier de Jakob Nielsen</a>, qui pr&#233;sente 
10 principes fondamentaux d'ergonomie des interfaces 
informatiques.

<blockquote>
<dl><dt><strong>Visibility of system status</strong></dt>

<dd><p>The system should always keep users informed about what
is going on, through appropriate feedback within reasonable
time.</p></dd>

<dt><strong>Match between system and the real world</strong></dt>

<dd><p>The system should speak the users' language, with words,
phrases and concepts familiar to the user, rather than
system-oriented terms. Follow real-world conventions, making
information appear in a natural and logical order.</p></dd>

<dt><strong>User control and freedom</strong></dt>

<dd><p>Users often choose system functions by mistake and will
need a clearly marked "emergency exit" to leave the unwanted
state without having to go through an extended dialogue.
Support undo and redo.</p></dd>

<dt><strong>Consistency and standards</strong></dt>

<dd><p>Users should not have to wonder whether different words,
situations, or actions mean the same thing. Follow platform
conventions.</p></dd>

<dt><strong>Error prevention</strong></dt>

<dd><p>Even better than good error messages is a careful design
which prevents a problem from occurring in the first
place.</p></dd>

<dt><strong>Recognition rather than recall</strong></dt>

<dd><p>Make objects, actions, and options visible. The user
should not have to remember information from one part of the
dialogue to another. Instructions for use of the system
should be visible or easily retrievable whenever
appropriate.</p></dd>

<dt><strong>Flexibility and efficiency of use</strong></dt>

<dd><p>Accelerators -- unseen by the novice user -- may often
speed up the interaction for the expert user such that the
system can cater to both inexperienced and experienced users.
Allow users to tailor frequent actions.</p></dd>

<dt><strong>Aesthetic and minimalist design</strong></dt>

<dd><p>Dialogues should not contain information which is
irrelevant or rarely needed. Every extra unit of information
in a dialogue competes with the relevant units of information
and diminishes their relative visibility.</p></dd>

<dt><strong>Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from
errors</strong></dt>

<dd><p>Error messages should be expressed in plain language (no
codes), precisely indicate the problem, and constructively
suggest a solution.</p></dd>

<dt><strong>Help and documentation</strong></dt>

<dd><p>Even though it is better if the system can be used
without documentation, it may be necessary to provide help
and documentation. Any such information should be easy to
search, focused on the user's task, list concrete steps to be
carried out, and not be too large.</p></dd></dl>
