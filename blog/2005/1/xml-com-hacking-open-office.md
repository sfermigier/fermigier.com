In this article, I'm going to explore some of the ways
that <a href="http://openoffice.org/">OpenOffice.org's</a>
Writer application (I'm using version 1.1.2 on Linux and 1.1.3
on Windows XP) is open to customization and configuration.
I'll walk through some of the techniques I used to set up the
first templates I built with the application in my quest for
an interoperable, XHTML-ready system of templates and styles
which will work across Microsoft Word and Writer.
