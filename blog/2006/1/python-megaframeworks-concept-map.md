<a href="/images/megaframeworks-v1.png">
png</a>, <a href="/assets/pdf/megaframeworks-v1.pdf">
pdf</a>) that I've just drawn to try to clarify the dependencies between the
so-called frameworks and "megaframeworks" and other Python packages.

I have tried to cover, so far:

<ul>
<li>Zope (w/ CPS as an example of a framework built on top of Zope)</li>

<li>TurboGears</li>

<li>Django</li>

<li>Subway</li>

<li>Pylons</li>
</ul>

Feel free to comment. I'm probably wrong in many places. (Even the CPS part
may be wrong ;) ).
