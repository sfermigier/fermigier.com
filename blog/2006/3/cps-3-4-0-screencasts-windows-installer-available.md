We've already posted an announcement on nuxeo.com (<a href="http://www.nuxeo.com/en/news/nuxeo-releases-cps-3-4/">here</a> in
english, and<a href="http://www.nuxeo.com/news/nuxeo-lance-cps-3-4/">here</a> in french),
as well as on zope.org (<a href="http://www.zope.org/Members/nuxeo/news/cps-3.4.0-released">here</a>)
and freshmeat (<a href="http://freshmeat.net/projects/nuxeocps/?branch_id=33975&amp;release_id=221725">
here</a>).

Now, the release and the early announcement are just the beginning, because
we really want people to try out this new version.<br><br>
We have created<a href="http://www.nuxeo.com/screencasts/cps-3.4/">our
first screencasts</a> (in Flash, using Macromedia Captivate - there is
nothing wrong with pyvnc2swf, but it only addresses capture, not
editing).

And we have a<a href="http://www.cps-project.org/static/windows/CPS-3.4.0-2.exe">Windows
installer</a>, that bundles about everything (Python, Zope, CPS, wvware,
ppthtml, xlhtml, xsltproc...) that's needed (even non-mandatory tools) to
run CPS on Windows, installs CPS in 4 clicks, and provide a GUI controller
for the CPS instance.

There is a lot more work to do (update cps-project.org, update the white
papers about CPS, more screencasts, create packages for Linux and MacOS,
etc.).
