<p>Tony Byrne has started <a href="http://www.cmswatch.com/Trends/1623-Social-Software-Debates?source=twitter#idc-container">a conversation</a> (warning: website is down at present) about Enterprise 2.0 (aka Enterprise Social Software) on CMSWatch.</p> 
 <p>Here are my comments (waiting for moderation on the CMSWatch site). </p> 
 <ul><li><p><em>Is &#8220;Enterprise 2.0&#8221; more meaningful than &#8220;Social Software&#8221;?</em></p>

<p>&#8220;Enterprise 2.0&#8221; is more than just social software. I define them with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SLATES">SLATES </a> and <a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/Hinchcliffe/?p=143">FLATNESS</a> paradigms.</p>

<p>And &#8220;Enterprise 2.0&#8221; is already pass&#233;. Let&#8217;s add semantics in the mix and call it &#8220;Enterprise 3.0&#8221; ;)</p></li>
<li><p><em>Blogging is pass&#233; &#8212; vive micro-blogging?</em></p>

<p>Blogging is pass&#233; for &#8220;hey look at this cool post on this guy&#8217;s blog&#8221; type of messages. But expressing complex ideas in less than 140 characters is not possible.</p>

<p>So micro-blogging is just another tool of the trade, just as blogging hasn&#8217;t replaced mailing list or forums, or IM hasn&#8217;t replaced email.</p>

<p>OTOH, I must admit that I&#8217;ve been blogging a lot less (and, more importantly, seeing much less blog posts by the people I follow on twitter) since I&#8217;ve started twittering.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Can social computing consistently bring real ROI?</em></p>

<p>In any context where collaboration and knowledge sharing is important, yes.</p>

<p>But &#8220;real&#8221; meetings and discussions are still relevant, though ;)</p></li>
<li><p><em>Should community managers have to worry about information lifecycle management?</em></p>

<p>Yes. There is content that you need to control, specially in the face of trolling and other destabilisation attacks.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Are social content ratings really helpful ?</em></p>

<p>With the right (for the given context) rating algorithm, yes.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Tools: suite or best of breed?</em></p>

<p>Integration is of paramount importance. World-class open APIs help, a lot, but some features just need to be deeply integrated, at the repository level.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Should your website/intranet have a community or be a community?</em></p>

<p>Be, of course.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Do you really need an enterprise micro-blogging tool when we have Twitter?</em></p>

<p>Yes. Most people / corporations don&#8217;t want to merge personal and professional lives as the &#8220;A-list&#8221; twitterers do, and there are obviously confidentiality issues.</p></li>
</ul>
