<p>Mike Milinkovich started the conference by highlighting the four ingredients of a great platform:</p><ol><li>Great technology</li>
<li>Broad adoption</li>
<li>&#8220;Architecture of participation&#8221;</li>
<li>Hijacked by the community</li>
</ol><h2 id="great_technology">Great technology</h2><p>Eclipse is a platform that you can extend through plugins. It is already well-known as a Java IDE, but there are plugins for many more languages (C/C++, Java, Python&#8230;). If you remove the language plugins, you are left with RCP, which is a great platform to build rich applications.</p><h2 id="broad_adoption">Broad adoption</h2><p>The Eclipse Foundation now has 150 members. Eclipse has about 60% market share in the Java IDE market. Eclipse 3.2 was downloaded 1 million times in the 47 days after its release. The eclipse.org website has 36000 unique visitors / day.</p><h2 id="architecture_of_participation">Architecture of participation</h2><p>The aim of an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architecture_of_participation">architecture of participation</a> is to create a &#8220;free market for ideas&#8221;, by lowering the barrier to entry for contributions. It has been enabled by the plugin system of Eclipse. &#8220;You need a cathedral to enable the bazaar!&#8221;: the core must be developped in a very rigourous manner, and then there must be a lot a freedom for people developing add-ons. </p><p>This is similar to the way Apache httpd is extended by different modules (mod_*) or to Mozilla Firefox extensions, etc. OpenOffice.org is also moving in this direction, thanks to the efforts of people like <a href="/sections/blogs/laurent_godard">Laurent Godard</a>.</p><h2 id="8220hijacked_by_the_community8221">&#8220;Hijacked by the community&#8221;</h2><p>&#8220;Hijacked&#8221; refers to a book called &#8220;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000BOB2UC/">Brand Highjack</a>&#8221; by Alex Wipperfurth (cool, a new book for me to read ;) ), which advocates &#8220;allowing customers to shape brand meaning and drive a brand&#8217;s evolution&#8221;. Mike, like me, is a reader of the &#8220;<a href="http://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/">creating passionate users</a>&#8221; blog by Cathy Sierra. He (or she?) says: &#8220;Fire the marketers. We are all marketers now&#8221;. Marketing is not done by other persons, but by ourselves as technologists.</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>In conclusion, Mike stressed that Eclipse RCP is the part of Eclipse with the greatest potential and highlighted a few success stories.</p><p>Overall, this was a great and inspiring keynote. The Eclipse architecture and process are both a tremendous inspiration for us with our <a href="http://www.nuxeo.org/">Nuxeo 5</a> project, where we also have developped a plugin archtecture (using the same underlying technology as Eclipse, OSGi), we aim for clean API for external developpers, we want to help build a community of third-party contributors and extenders though, and of course we are using Eclipse as a <a href="http://www.nuxeo.com/en/java-switch">Java</a> IDE and as the foundation for our <a href="http://www.nuxeo.org/sections/projects/rcp">Nuxeo RCP</a> project.</p>
