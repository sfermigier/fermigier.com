<p>So I was today speaking at the ICSSEA conference on software engineering about our experience building Nuxeo EP.</p>

<p>The slides are below:</p><div style="width:425px" id="__ss_6079337"><strong style="display:block;margin:12px 0 4px"><a href="https://www.slideshare.net/nuxeo/lessons-learned-building-nuxeo-ep-componentbase-open-source-ecm-platform" title="Lessons learned Building Nuxeo EP - Component-based, open source ECM platform">Lessons learned Building Nuxeo EP - Component-based, open source ECM platform</a></strong><object id="__sse6079337" width="425" height="355"><param name="movie" value="http://static.slidesharecdn.com/swf/ssplayer2.swf?doc=icssea-slides2010-101208103415-phpapp01&amp;stripped_title=lessons-learned-building-nuxeo-ep-componentbase-open-source-ecm-platform&amp;userName=nuxeo"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"><param name="allowScriptAccess" value="always"><embed name="__sse6079337" src="http://static.slidesharecdn.com/swf/ssplayer2.swf?doc=icssea-slides2010-101208103415-phpapp01&amp;stripped_title=lessons-learned-building-nuxeo-ep-componentbase-open-source-ecm-platform&amp;userName=nuxeo" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="425" height="355"></embed></object><div style="padding:5px 0 12px">View more presentations from <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/nuxeo">Nuxeo - Open Source ECM</a>.</div></div>

<p>This presentation is of course based on <a href="http://blogs.nuxeo.com/fermigier/2010/12/software-engineering-lessons-learned-developing-nuxeo-open-source-component-ecm-platform.html">the paper</a> I wrote with some of Nuxeo's R&amp;D team members.</p>

<p>I also recycled a few slides from <a href="http://blogs.nuxeo.com/fermigier/2008/12/video-slides-transcript-my-talk-at-nuxeo-devday.html">The Nuxeo Way</a>, a presentation I gave two years ago at the Nuxeo DevDay and of wich you can still read the full transcript or watch a video recording.</p>

<p>Today's talk was longer, however, and I have incorporated several more insights, notably on choosing the right standards and open source libraries, on the Nuxeo EP architecture as an enabler for ecosystem building, on community engagement, or on comparison with other systems.</p>
