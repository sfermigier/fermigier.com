As you already know, <a href="http://blogs.nuxeo.com/sections/blogs/fermigier/2006_03_31_tag-your-cps-sites-on-del-icio-us">I have started two weeks ago tagging</a> (and asking others to tag) their CPS sites on del.icio.us with the tag "cps-site". I think we have spotted about <a href="http://del.icio.us/tag/cps-site">80 public CPS sites so far</a>, but I'm sure many are still missing.
</p><p>
BTW: how do you know a website is a CPS site? There are several clues: 1. Look at the icon, if present. 2. Look at the urls (if it contains "section" it's probably a CPS site). 3. Look at the HTTP "Server" header.
</p><p>
Now I have a similar idea: there are many <a href="">Trac</a> site out there, and Trac is one of the "Python killer-apps". So let's tag also Trac sites with the <a href="http://del.icio.us/tag/trac-site">trac-site</a> tag and see what happens.
