summary: "In a somewhat subtle self-promoting exercise thechangelog.com has an interesting post called \"Top ten reasons why I won't use your open source project\" and while it somewhat applies to smaller, younger projects, we thought (as our friends of the Glassfish project recently did) we'd benchmark the Nuxeo project on those reasons."

In a somewhat subtle self-promoting exercise <a href="http://thechangelog.com">thechangelog.com</a>
has an interesting post called <a href="http://thechangelog.com/post/3032074343/top-ten-reasons-why-i-wont-use-your-open-source-project">"Top ten reasons why I won't use your open source
project"</a> and while it somewhat applies to smaller, younger projects, we
thought (as <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/theaquarium/entry/top_10_reasons_for_open">our friends of the Glassfish project recently did</a>) we'd benchmark the
Nuxeo project on those reasons.</p>

<h3>7. Your licensing is unclear</h3>

We're LGPL. See:

<h3>8. You don't reach out to me</h3>

Besides <a href="http://twitter.com/nuxeo">Twitter (@nuxeo)</a>, we also encourage you to join the <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/groups?mostPopular=&amp;gid=43314">Nuxeo User group on LinkedIn</a>, watch <a href="http://www.youtube.com/nuxeo/">videos and screencasts on Nuxeo.TV</a>, look at <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/nuxeo/presentations">our slide deck collection on SlideShare</a> or subscribe to <a href="http://community.nuxeo.com/rss">our RSS feed</a>.

<h3>9. You don't speak about your project at conferences and meetups</h3>

See our <a href="http://www.nuxeo.com/en/about/events">events pages</a>.

We even <a href="http://www.nuxeo.com/en/about/events/nuxeoworld2010">organize conferences</a> to keep our community updated and reach out to new users.

<h3>10. You didn't submit it to The Changelog</h3>

OK, we didn't do (because we had no idea they existed). We'll try to fix this ASAP.

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

I think we didn't fare too bad on that test. The alternative would have surprised me, given we've been doing this <a href="http://www.nuxeo.com/en/about/choose-nuxeo">for the last 10 years</a> and have been pionneering this model, in the context of <a href="http://www.nuxeo.com/en">Enterprise Content Management</a>.

So, what do you think? Is there any way we should improve the way the Nuxeo project is managed to get more people on board?
