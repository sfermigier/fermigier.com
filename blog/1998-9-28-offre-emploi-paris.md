<BLOCKQUOTE>
We are looking for a programmer familiar with UNIX/Linux who will work
with us on three disctinct tasks:
<UL>

<LI>Developper/sys-admin of our Ski IN global ski guide website.
Ski IN is one of the largest ski and winter sports guides on the net
with inormation on over 2300 resorts in 60 countries presented in four
languages.  We view this product both as a prototype for our content
management developments (see below) and as a profit centre.  The product
runs on Red Hat with an Apache server and MySQL databases.  Front end
programming is mostly in ModPerl with some server side JAVA.
<LI>Development of Web and Intranet applications for our service
customers.  We currently service such customers as Lapeyre group
(Solaris), Les Complices (NT and Linux), International Herald Tribune
(Linux), L'Oreal (NT).  One of the roles of the developper will be to
help develop functionality for our Unix based customers using standard
programming environments (PERL and server side java - linked to
databases).  Possibility of incorporating Netscape server software also
to be considered depending on the profile of the candidate.
<LI>New tools development.
We have a strategic objective to create a set of tools to help webstite
managers manage the content in their sites.  The product would ideally
be developed in Java for portability but optimised for LINUX. The
candidate would help us to develop and architect certain modules of this
software.
</UL>
