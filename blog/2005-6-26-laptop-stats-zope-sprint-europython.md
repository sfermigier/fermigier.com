Here are some stats about the laptops used by the Zope sprinters in Europython:

<ul>
<li>13 Apple notebooks (all of them 15'' Titanium btw)</li>
<li>5 Dell notebooks</li>
<li>1 IBM X40 subnotebook<br></li>
<li>1 ASUS S5 subnotebook (mine :) )</li>
<li>2 no-name notebooks (MITAC)</li>
</ul> 
  
All the non-Apple notebooks seem to be running some variant of Linux (no 
Windows in sight).

Some of the titanium seem brand new, and all their owners seem to be proud 
of using the "<a href="http://www.pbs.org/cringely/pulpit/pulpit20050609.html">world's most
advanced obsolete computer</a>" :)
