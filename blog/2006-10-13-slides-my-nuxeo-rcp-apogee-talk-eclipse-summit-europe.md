I&#8217;m just coming back from the <a href="http://www.eclipsecon.org/summiteurope2006/">Eclipse Summit Europe 2006</a> which was a great conference (more reports on this blog later).
  
I had the chance to do a short (20 minutes) but exciting ( ;) ) presentation of two projects we are involved in: <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/proposals/apogee/">Apogee</a> and <a href="http://www.nuxeo.org/sections/projects/rcp">Nuxeo RCP</a>.

My <a href="http://www.nuxeo.org/sections/about/slides/apogee-nuxeo-rcp-from">slides are now online</a> on nuxeo.org, or <a href="http://www.eclipsecon.org/summiteurope2006/index.php?page=detail/&amp;id=20">on the conference website</a>.
