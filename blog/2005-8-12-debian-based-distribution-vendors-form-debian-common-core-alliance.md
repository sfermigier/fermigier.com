The <a href="http://www.dccalliance.org/press.html">press release</a> says 
it:

<blockquote>
Major Linux vendors and
non-profit organizations today officially launched the DCC Alliance. The
Alliance plans to assemble a common, standards-based Debian core for
Debian-based Linux distributions, accelerate worldwide commercial adoption
of Debian, promote compatibility among the growing community of Debian
derivatives, and work with Debian on features important to commercial
adoption such as a predictable release cycle and Linux Standard Base (LSB)
compliance.
</blockquote> 

Interestingly, Ubuntu is not part of the <a href="http://www.dccalliance.org/members.html">founding members</a>.
