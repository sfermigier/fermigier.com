Florent Guillaume is in the US this week for the first face-to-face meeting of the CMIS working group since the project got accepted by OASIS a few months ago. We&#8217;ll get a clearer roadmap for the specification (which, last time I checked, was supposed to go gold by the end of 2009 or beginning of 2010).

A prototype miminal implementation of CMIS 0.5 (the most recent draft) on top of WebEngine, using all the power of JAX-RS annotations, is now publicly available (<a href="http://hg.nuxeo.org/sandbox/nuxeo-cmis/">http://hg.nuxeo.org/sandbox/nuxeo-cmis/</a>).
