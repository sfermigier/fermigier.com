## Introduction & Context

In the bustling heart of global diplomacy, the United Nations Headquarters in New York City, the [OSPOs for Good 2024 Conference convened](https://www.un.org/techenvoy/content/ospos-good-2024), marking a significant milestone in the intersection of open source technology and international development. Against the backdrop of the UN’s ambitious Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), this two-day event brought together a diverse array of participants—from seasoned technologists to policy makers, and community advocates—to explore the transformative potential of open source in addressing some of the world's most pressing challenges.

The conference was grounded in the vision outlined in the UN Secretary-General’s policy brief, “[A Global Digital Compact](https://www.un.org/techenvoy/global-digital-compact) — an Open, Free and Secure Digital Future for All,” and the “[Roadmap for Digital Cooperation](https://www.un.org/en/content/digital-cooperation-roadmap/).” These documents underscore the critical role of open source in fostering innovation, enhancing transparency, and ensuring inclusive digital development. With open source technologies becoming increasingly integral to global digital infrastructure, the OSPOs for Good 2024 aimed to highlight how these tools can be leveraged to accelerate progress toward the SDGs.

Attendees were welcomed into the historic corridors of the UN's Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC), where the juxtaposition of diplomatic formality and tech community vibrancy set the stage for dynamic discussions. The event’s agenda was meticulously crafted to address a broad spectrum of topics, from the integration of artificial intelligence in open source frameworks to the unique innovations emerging from the Global South. Keynotes and panel discussions featured thought leaders and experts who shared insights and strategies on harnessing open source for public good, fostering collaboration, and building resilient digital ecosystems.

The conference underscored a pivotal theme: while open source technology has matured, there remains a crucial need to bridge gaps between policy and practice, and to foster environments where innovation and inclusivity can thrive. From the halls of the UN to local communities worldwide, the discussions aimed to pave the way for a future where open source not only powers technological advancement but also drives equitable and sustainable development for all.
