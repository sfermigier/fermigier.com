## My comments

While the "Toward European Digital Independence: Building the Euro Stack" conference addressed key aspects of digital sovereignty, collaboration, and public infrastructure, there are significant gaps in the practical realization of these initiatives. Organizations like [APELL](https://apell.info/), [Euclidia](https://www.euclidia.eu/), [CNLL](https://cnll.fr/), and others must engage with relevant stakeholders to ensure that these gaps are acknowledged and addressed, particularly with respect to **open-source software** and the role of **SMEs**.

### Open Source as the Foundation for Digital Sovereignty

The discussions at the conference rightly emphasized the need for European digital sovereignty, but I believe they did not go far enough in positioning open-source software (OSS) as the foundation of this sovereignty. For Europe to truly control its technology stack and avoid dependency on non-European actors, **OSS must be a non-negotiable principle**, with policies like **"Open Source First"** in public procurement and **"Public Money, Public Code"** as mandatory for any publicly funded projects. As APELL and CNLL have argued, **OSS offers transparency, security, and autonomy**, which are critical elements for any sovereign digital infrastructure. Europe’s "Euro Stack" must not only be European-controlled but also built on **open, interoperable, and accessible OSS technologies**. This approach ensures that European SMEs and citizens can actively contribute to and benefit from these systems while reducing the risks of vendor lock-in and extraterritorial influence from large non-European hyperscalers.

### The Role of SMEs in Europe’s Digital Ecosystem

I strongly believe that the role of European **SMEs** was underemphasized in the discussions. Euclidia has consistently stressed that **SMEs must be at the core** of any European digital strategy. SMEs in the cloud and software sectors are often the most innovative and agile players, able to bring forward disruptive technologies that larger corporations may overlook. Public procurement processes should be restructured to **prioritize SMEs** and **open-source projects**, offering them more opportunities to scale and compete. Without this focus, we risk allowing the Euro Stack to be dominated by a few large players, sidelining the potential of smaller but highly innovative companies. This is not just a question of economic fairness, but one of **diversity and resilience** in Europe’s technological ecosystem.

### Avoiding Redundant Competition and Duplication of Efforts

The creation of a Euro Stack must avoid the pitfalls seen in France with **La Suite Numérique**, which was recently [criticized by the French Court of Auditors and CNLL](https://cnll.fr/news/rapport-cour-des-comptes-dinum/) for its **high cost, low usage, and competition** with existing market solutions. Europe must **leverage and build on existing OSS solutions** rather than trying to reinvent the wheel without the resources and expertise to properly act as an open source vendor. Its efforts should focus on **integrating and improving** what already exists in the European open-source landscape, such as projects developed by **European SMEs**. A unified strategy that builds on **existing strengths** will prevent fragmentation and ensure that European funds are spent efficiently, fostering innovation without duplicating efforts.

### Ensuring Effective Coordination and Execution

A recurring theme in the conference was the challenge of **coordination** across European member states and sectors. I fully agree with the concerns raised, and I believe that the Euro Stack initiative must prioritize **collaborative frameworks** that bring together national governments, SMEs, and open-source communities. As seen with GAIA-X, **failure to execute** on these collaborations can result in stalled projects and missed opportunities. CNLL and Euclidia have been vocal in the past about the amount of red tape and the lack of openness and actual code within the GAIA-X initiative. Europe must also avoid **overly bureaucratic** processes that stifle innovation—streamlining regulatory and operational hurdles, especially for SMEs, will be critical for the success of the Euro Stack. We must **accelerate harmonization efforts** across member states and ensure **regulatory flexibility** to accommodate diverse players in the tech ecosystem. The CRA is an unfortunate example of Europe lack of understanding of, and willingness to work with, the open source ecosystem during its legislative process.

### Sustainable Financing and Long-Term Support for Open Source

The conference did not sufficiently address the need for **sustainable financing** mechanisms, especially for **open-source projects**. Open-source software requires continuous maintenance, development, and community engagement to remain secure and viable. Public sector funding should be allocated not just for the development of new tools but also for the **long-term sustainability** of existing open-source projects. Without this, Europe risks relying on underfunded tools that are vulnerable to obsolescence or co-option by larger, non-European companies. Both **Euclidia and CNLL** have argued that **OSS projects must receive ongoing public support** to ensure they can scale and remain resilient in the face of global competition.

### Open Cloud and Avoiding Hyperscaler Lock-In

The emphasis on building a **European cloud stack** is a step in the right direction, but I believe the focus must remain firmly on **open-source solutions** within this stack. As the discussions on **data sovereignty** revealed, the dominance of U.S. and Chinese hyperscalers poses a significant threat to European autonomy. **The solution, however, is not merely to replicate these giants in Europe**. Instead, we must focus on building a cloud ecosystem that is **open, modular, and interoperable**, allowing for **vendor-neutral solutions** that can be easily adopted and scaled by European businesses. This will prevent **lock-in** and give Europe the flexibility it needs to adapt to changing technological landscapes.

### Building Digital Skills through Open-Source Education

I agree with the panelists who emphasized the importance of **education and skills development**, but I believe we need to be more specific. The future of Europe’s digital sovereignty depends on a workforce that is **fluent in open-source development and cloud technologies**. I think Europe must embed **OSS principles** into its ICT curricula, fostering the next generation of open-source developers and engineers. **APELL and CNLL** have long advocated for **cross-border educational initiatives** that focus on building a **culture of openness**, ensuring that Europe’s digital future is both innovative and self-reliant.

### The Euro Stack Must Reflect European Values of Transparency and Democracy

The Euro Stack’s success will depend on its **alignment with European values**, such as **privacy, transparency, and inclusivity**. Europe has a unique opportunity to lead by example in the global digital economy by promoting **privacy by design**, **open governance models**, and **non-extractive business practices**. The **digital commons** model discussed in the conference provides a viable path forward, but I believe it must be expanded to ensure that **civil society, SMEs, and open-source communities** have a meaningful role in shaping and governing Europe’s digital infrastructure.

### Leveraging Horizon Europe for Bottom-Up Open Source R&D Funding

I believe that **Horizon Europe** offers a significant opportunity to drive innovation in the open-source ecosystem. However, there needs to be a stronger **bottom-up approach** in R&D funding, where funding instruments are designed to directly benefit **open-source SMEs and independent projects**. Most current funding structures favor large-scale projects, which can inadvertently exclude smaller, agile players from the open-source community. A focus on **decentralized, small-scale projects** that empower open-source developers and SMEs will not only accelerate innovation but also create a **more sustainable, diverse, and resilient** European tech ecosystem. The **Next Generation Internet (NGI)** initiative has demonstrated how targeted, flexible funding mechanisms can support open-source innovation, contributing to Europe’s digital sovereignty. This model must be preserved, and improved with more focus on actionable results, in the upcoming iterations of the Horizon Europe programme. By advocating for **targeted funding instruments** within Horizon Europe, we can help ensure that the **open-source ecosystem** becomes a pillar of Europe's digital sovereignty, with **public funding** aligned to foster collaboration, interoperability, and long-term growth of European-led open technologies.

### Conclusion: A European Digital Future Rooted in Openness and Collaboration

In conclusion, I believe that Europe’s digital future must be **rooted in openness**, both in terms of **technology** and **collaboration**. The Euro Stack has the potential to secure Europe’s digital sovereignty, but only if it is built on a **foundation of open-source software**, with **SMEs** and **open-source communities** at its core. By avoiding duplication, streamlining regulations, and providing sustainable financial support, Europe can create a digital ecosystem that is **resilient, inclusive, and competitive** on the global stage. Importantly, funding must not only come from **R&D programs**, but also through **contracts with actual open-source innovators**, ensuring that public sector investments are directed toward those who are already contributing to the open-source ecosystem and to products that are supported and maintained. This approach will help scale and maintain critical OSS infrastructure, and foster long-term innovation and sustainability. I strongly advocate for a **distributed, ecosystem-driven approach** to building the Euro Stack, one that prioritizes **open standards**, **collaboration**, and **long-term sustainability**.
