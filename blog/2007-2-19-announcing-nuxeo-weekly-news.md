I have just published the <a href="http://www.nuxeo.org/sections/news/nuxeo-weekly-news-issue">second issue of Nuxeo Weekly News</a>, the newsletter we have started to publish every monday to keep the Nuxeo community informed of what&#8217;s going on with the project, and to provide some insight about where we are heading.

For those who missed it, <a href="http://www.nuxeo.org/sections/news/nuxeo-weekly-new-issue-1">the first issue</a> is still available.

I will appreciate any feedback (positive or negative) about it.
